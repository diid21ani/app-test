## Virtual Host on local machine
I created and configurred virtual url for application which run app automatic with http://test-app.test URL, I made changes in window "host" and apache "httpd-vhosts.conf" file.

## Containarization  through Docker
I used following steps to create docker files and docker image creation
1. Initialize docker in root folder via "docker init" command, this commands generated required files such as "Dockerfile","compose.yml",".dockerignore" etc files
2. run the "docker compose up --build" command to create build, docker image and run container, docker push to push images over docker Hub.
